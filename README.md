Corporate Directory App [![Appcelerator Titanium](http://www-static.appcelerator.com/badges/titanium-git-badge-sq.png)](http://appcelerator.com/titanium/)
=======================

![][expanded-app]


Everyone needs to have quick and easy access to their business contacts. This corporate directory application showcases how you can easily build a high quality, cross platform application using the Appcelerator Mobile Platform.

Key App Features 
----------------

#### master Branch
+ A master / detail application using a customized ListView
+ Searchable List
+ ListViewSections created based on last name initial
+ ListView Indexes (iOS only)
+ Native Navigation Patterns using NavigationWindow for iOS and standard Windows for Android
+ Includes native hooks to Maps, Email and Phone applications
+ Loading data from local Filesystem

#### data-binding Branch
+ Collection data binding to ListView
+ Model / View binding on the Profile Page
+ Uses Alloy Models to sync sample data to the SQLite database

_Note: The data-binding branch does not create ListViewSections in the directory view._

Quick Start
-----------
+ Open **Appcelerator Studio** and from the menu select _File -> Import..._
+ In the **Import** dialog that opens, make sure the you expand the _Git_ folder and select _Git Repository as New Project_
+ Click the **URI** radio button option and paste URL of this repository into the text field
+ Click _Finish_

_Note: By default this project will be downloaded and cloned into your existing workspace_

App Navigation
--------------
While the Directory app seems pretty full featured, its primarily a basic master / detail view application. 

![Directory App Navigation][app-navigation-gif]

+ MasterView => Directory Listing
    + View Contacts in Searchable List
    + Access Bookmarks
    + Quick Index Search - swipe left to reveal List Index (iOS Only)
    
+ DetailView => Profile View
    + View Contact information
    + Add/Remove Contact as Bookmark
    + One Click to Email
    + One Click to Call

There is also one other view, for viewing your bookmarked contacts, but as you can see in the code we are actually _re-using_ the same Directory Listing as the MasterView, and just filtering the contacts based on which ones are bookmarks. This is a great technique for when you need to show content, but simply need to filter by a particular property etc.




Bookmarks
---------
To quickly access people that you contact more frequently, this Directory application allows you to easily bookmark a contact for quick reference later. Bookmarked contacts are denoted by a light blue ribbon. 

![Bookmarked Contact][bookmark-indicator]

You can access your bookmarked contacts at anytime by clicking on the _book_ icon next to the search bar (on iOS) or in the action bar (on Android). 

Adding a bookmark is easy, as the image below demonstrates.
